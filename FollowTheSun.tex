\section{Abstract}

Humans have navigated by the sun for millennia, relying on its predictable path across the sky to determine their own heading relative to north. We have applied Machine Learning algorithms to this practice in an attempt to do the same through static images. Data was collected from three different areas in the US, all with different latitudes.
